a little more fluid through a little quicker but it's really good for now and I see that you have kind of a little  
### 25分経過  
sentences if you have a good understanding of the language is actually important for you to start listening to some loud  
pronunciation call. As well shoot some new words sentences as also speaking English as much as possible even by yourself just back is forming sentences saying what's on your mind make up some stories by yourself just to speak as much as possible as other than that they hope you have a wonderful day  
take care
